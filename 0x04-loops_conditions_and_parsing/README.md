## General
   - How to create SSH keys
   - What is the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
   - How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops
   - How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements

### Tasks: ###

1. **Task 0: SSH RSA key pair.** `0-RSA_public_key.pub`
   - SSH and RSA keys will be covered in depth in a later project.

2. **Task 1: For loop.** `1-for_best_school`
   - Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times:
     - using `for` loop.

3. **Task 2: While loop.** `2-while_best_school`
   - Bash script that displays Best School 10 times:
     - using `while` loop.

4. **Task 3: Until loop.** `3-until_best_school`
   - Bash script that displays Best School 10 times.
     - using `until` loop.

5. **Task 4: If statement.** `4-if_9_say_hi`
   - Bash script that displays Best School 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, displays Best School and then Hi on a new line.
